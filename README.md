Blockchain Technology is cool because it can empower the everyday consumer. I envision it to be an insane version of Ebay. Imagine being able to auction off everything you own digitally from Promo codes to video games. Once someone builds a layer one blockchain all of this will be possible. This app is aimed to show what that potential could look like.

This is a simple sports betting app (All of the data is auto-generated cause I can't afford $50 a month for data #HireMe) but the twist is all bets can be auctioned off and traded.

When a user places a bet, they can mint it into a tradable coin. A BetCoin. This BetCoin can then be traded and auctioned off on the BetCoin ledger and be cashed out at any sportsbook that accepts BetCoin. 


To show users a real-world example I have built three Sports books on top of my [Sports Generate](https://github.com/CSnowden1/MockSportsBettingAPI) API and BetCoin Cyprto Currency.

This is the Vue and Tailwind based Sports Book called "Bit Betting HQ"
